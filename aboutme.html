        <h1>About me!</h1>
I am a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island, currently I am a finance major but I am considering transiting to a computer science minor or major! I am originally from Rhode Island but I have also lived in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I come from a big family with thirty six cousins!<br>
